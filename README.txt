If Composer is installed globally on your system, you can run the following in the base directory of your project to add the SDK as a dependency:

composer require block-chen/blocksdk-php

<?php
use BlockSDK;

$blockSDK = new BlockSDK("YOU_TOKEN");
$btcClient = $blockSDK->createBitcoin();

//or

$btcClient = BlockSDK::createBitcoin("YOU_TOKEN");
Get Address info
<?php
$addressInfo = $btcClient->getAddressInfo([
    "address" => "18cBEMRxXHqzWWCxZNtU91F5sbUNKhL5PX",
